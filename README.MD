# Waste Classification using YOLOv5

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting and classifying different types of waste using the YOLOv5 deep learning model.  
It helps in smart waste management and automated recycling systems.

## 🧠 Waste Categories
- Plastic
- Metal
- Paper
- Glass
- Organic Waste

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLOv5
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Google Colab

## 📂 Dataset
- Custom waste image dataset
- Annotated using Roboflow / LabelImg

## ⚙️ Working Method
1. Input image or video is provided
2. YOLOv5 model detects waste objects
3. Bounding boxes with labels are generated
4. Waste is classified into categories

## 📊 Results
The model successfully detects and classifies waste items with good accuracy.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Real-time camera-based detection
- Mobile application integration
- More waste categories
